^ Hello and Welcome to Redbooth! I'm Sergi Gracia, iOS developer here @ Redbooth and we are very excited to hold our first iOS talk in our office.
First of all we would like to know: How many people here knows anything about Redbooth? and how many of you used Redbooth in the last year?
Before the talk about Viper and for those who don't know our company or didn't try our product recently, let me do a quick introduction about Redbooth.

## Redbooth Mobile Team

^ so before start with the technical talk let me introduce the Redbooth Mobile Team. When I arrived to Redbooth, almost 2 years ago, the iOS and android apps were being developed by contractors and we decided to start building our internal mobile team.

---

![fit](assets/mobileteam.png)

^ so after some months we grew up to 3 Android developers and 3 iOS developers. During the last year and a half we had to deal with big changes in our apps, new big features and big refactors... to make that possible we had to start thinking about clean architecture because our apps became bigger and more complex. As a result nowadays we are migrating all our controllers to VIPER.
